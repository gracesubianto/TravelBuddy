<!-- ## Project Management

The project planning and management process is tracked via Trello, following an Agile inspired workflow.

Project requirements were reviewed and broken down into tasks, as seen in the overall Project Backlog list.
Development of the project was broken down into 3 Sprints. Each Sprint has its' own backlog, and once development starts tasks are moved into the To Do, In Progress and Complete lists respectively.

Each Sprint also has a Retrospective list used to track any issues during development. These are structured using the Rose, Bud, Thorn framework.
